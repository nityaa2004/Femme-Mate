            During menstruation, it&#39;s essential for anyone, including girls, to maintain a balanced diet rich in iron, calcium, and vitamins to support overall health and
             manage menstrual symptoms. Some foods that may be beneficial during periods include:<br />
            Iron-rich foods like spinach, red meat, lentils, and fortified cereals to help replenish iron lost during menstruation.<br />
            Foods high in calcium such as dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified non-dairy milk to support bone health and alleviate cramps.<br />
            Magnesium-rich foods like nuts, seeds, whole grains, and dark chocolate, which may help reduce bloating and muscle cramps.<br />
            Foods high in vitamin B6, such as bananas, chicken, potatoes, and fish, which can help regulate mood swings and reduce water retention.<br />
            Omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts, which may help reduce inflammation and ease menstrual pain.<br />
            It&#39;s also important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water and herbal teas to help alleviate bloating and flush out toxins. 
            Additionally, listening to your body and consuming foods that you find comforting and easy to digest can also be beneficial during menstruation. <p></p>

           Cobra, Cat, Cow and Fish yoga poses are a few good exercises for you to try. They may help you cope with heavy cramping, and are best for
             your heavier menstrual days. Stretches are best done when the body is warm (as it is after a bath or shower). Each stretch should be held for 
             30 to 60 seconds.<br />
            Because of the slump in energy during menstruation, low-intensity aerobic exercises, such as swimming, yoga, strength training and light cardio
             – including walking and cycling – can be easier on the body. They&#39;re non-weight bearing activities and not very endurance heavy.
